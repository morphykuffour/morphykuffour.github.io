My main goal of writing this blog post is to simply provdie a helpful supplement to other build guides 
I followed while building my dacytl manuform. Some of these guides 
that was extremely helpful that many guides I followed glossed neccessary information over probably assuming prior knowledge.

Total Cost excluding optional parts: NaN (Not including shipping and taxes)

## Notes on Materials
The switches you decide to use will can change your total cost drastically. 
The key switches is where you want to ball out and pimp your keybaord. 
Research carefully  and select the key switches you want. 
If you end up going with alps switches make sure to get the proper keycaps
If you want to save some money buy most of these on aliexpress but the 
downside is the shipping time which is usually over 30 days

if you buy the non hotswappable case from andrew which is what I recommend after completing this build
and if you decide you want a hostwappable keybaord then I would highly recommend the Amoeba Single-Switch PCBs. 
The only annoying part of the single pcbs from keebio is that 1 order has 30 pcs and you need 64 pieces of the
PCB for the dactyl build so you end spending extra for the extra 4 PCBs. 


is where you want to focus 
Make sure to listen to key switches sound tests and look at ke
The amoeba pcbs are not neccessary if you handwire but if you get a non
Your regular aux cable will not because it is a trs cable and you need a trrs cable in order to transmit data signals between the two pro micros

## Notes on Materials
* I would advice going to a maker studio to build as they will have many of the tools I listed above 
but if you going to build more things in the future I would recommend investing in some of these tools,
Do not cheap out on the tools if you decide to build at home because you will end up wasting 
your time which will make your build process painful and future projects a misery.

 * For the soldering tool I would recommend the hakko station I linked above or better yet a Soldering pencil because of (You want small fine tip for the gun or pencil) | 
Personally, I purchased a Hakko FX888D-23BY Digital Soldering Station and used my desoldering pump I purchased from my ECE class 


## Compiling code for custom QMK keymaps
If you are on windows follow the windows tab o from the follwing link in order to setup your build environment. [Setup QMK build Enivronment](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_build_tools?id=set-up-your-environment)
I used 
Setup QMK and QMK toolbox on Macos

[Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
[Install qmk](https://qmk.fm/)
```bash
brew install qmk/qmk/qmk
```
Make sure to read the output from the installation of the qmk software installation. 
It will inform you if you need to install any additionaly dependencies neccessary for build and compiling your .hex file

[Install a proper editor ;) ](https://neovim.io/)
```bash
brew install neovim
```

[Install qmk toolbox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox/releases)
The annoying thing on windows is that every time you connect the pro mirco 
by usb the os thinks it is being "smart" by automatically installing drivers for the pro micro
so you have to be physically fast clicking on flash in order to flash the hex file before windows recognizes the chip as a different device.

You do not have to install qmk toolbox if you don't want as qmk supports flashing the hex file you generate from the command line.
QMK toolbox is just easier and less error prone.

## My C Further customizations going forward
![Intial 3D Printout](/morphykuffour.github.io/assests/morphy-/dactyl_printout.jpg)

## misc advice 

* add a reset key to a layer (RESET) through the firware

* use the jumper wires I linked above as the wires you connect to the pro mircos and pcb or the hot swaps or 
directly to the key switches if you decide to not go for a hotswappable build.

* if you decide to directly solder the switches make sure to get glue sticks 
the gun glue I linked above has plenty of glue included. 

* You will aslo want NKRO (N-Key Rollover) to prevent ghosting â€” letters missing from what you actually typed, 
or additional letters that you didn't type. 
NKRO should be possible naturally if you add a diode to each key switch. You will also want to enable NKRO in 
the keyboard's firmware by editing the rules.mk file in both of your custom folders.

* if you building the dactyl manuform you have the option to use a RJ-9 female to female connection to connect the 
two halves. If I had to start over I would have gone with this approach because you don't have to remember to
always connect the two halves first before connecting to your computer.
 
## Mistakes I made
Getting the case printed without the Kalih Hot swap holders and using the amoeba PCBs. <br \>

This would save some money. Also the plastic holders in the hotswap case 3D print by Andrew 
did not really hold the hot swaps in place well, they kept falling out.
